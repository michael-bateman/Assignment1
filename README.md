# Michael's Chemistry Game

I made this game part of my Grade 10 Computer Science class. The [first version](https://github.com/michael-bateman/Chemistry-Game/tree/v1) was the text based game. Now, the game has grown to a _almost_ fully functional GUI game.

## How to play

1. Download Java
2. Compile the code
3. Run the `Game2_MB2ZZZEncap.class`
