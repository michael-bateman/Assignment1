# Michael's Chemistry Game

_This project is no longer being updates_

I made this game part of my Grade 10 Computer Science class. The [first version](https://github.com/michael-bateman/Chemistry-Game/tree/v1) was the text based game. Now, the game has grown to a _almost_ fully functional GUI game.

## How to play

1. Download Java
2. Compile the code
3. Run the `Game2_MB2ZZZEncap.class`

## Bugs

1. The screen has a weird screen animation when loading a new image
2. The following elements pictures do not show up and will show up as a triangle:
  a. Ununhexium
  b. Wolfram
  c. Ununquadium
